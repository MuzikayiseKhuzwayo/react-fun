   <h2>These are some awesome reasons why I'm excited to be learning React</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>React is Composable, which means that I can build my codebase to be more readable, understandable and reusable for myself and other people</li>
    <li>React is Declarative, which means I won't have to spend hours writing elements and their dependent state parameters, React will just assume them for me and display something that works. This not only saves time, but also increases productivity</li>
    <li>React is Maintained by Facebook!! I mean Mark Zuckerberg.. Like come on bro... WHy wouldn't I want to be a part of this.</li>
    <li>React powers major Apps and mobile Applications, so If I learn it, I could be creating some awesome stuff in the future</li>
   </ol>
